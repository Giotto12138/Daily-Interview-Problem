Split the word by spaces, and then iterate through reversing each word.
This can be done like so:

class Solution:
  def reverseWords(self, str):
    words = str.split(" ")
    reverse=''
    for word in words:
      word = word[::-1]
      if reverse =='':
        reverse = word
      else:
        reverse = reverse +" "+word
    return reverse 

print Solution().reverseWords("The cat in the hat")
# ehT tac ni eht tah

The split takes linear time in a single pass. Then we iterate through each word and reverse them -- this is also in linear time. We're using linear space for storing the array of words.
