By processing from right to left, we only increment the count when the number is greater than the last largest number.

def witnesses(heights):
  witness_count = 0
  tallest = 0
  for 
 height in heights[::-1]:
    if height > tallest:
      tallest = height
      witness_count += 1

  return witness_count

print witnesses([3, 6, 3, 4, 1])
# 3

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) since there is a one-pass through the list. The space complexity is O(1) because we are not using any additional space except for a variable.
