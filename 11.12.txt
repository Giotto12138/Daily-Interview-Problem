Given a mathematical expression with just single digits, plus signs, negative signs, and brackets, evaluate the expression. Assume the expression is properly formed.

Example:
Input: - ( 3 + ( 2 - 1 ) )
Output: -4
Here's the function signature:

def eval(expression):
  # Fill this in.

print eval('- (3 + ( 2 - 1 ) )')
# -4
